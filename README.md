# Command-Runner

This is simple learning exercise to use a golang web api to serve up a form to run commands against an IOS-XE device.

Scrapligo is used to execute the CLI command with the output returned back to the browser.

Note this is purely for learning purposes in terms of integrating the API with Scrapligo and is not intended for a Production use case
